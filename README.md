# Capstone_Project
Student Project for Medpick - Blockchain

This is my contribution for UMass Boston's Information Technology's Capstone Project.

The problem proposed to us by Medpick was about transport security, and using blockchain to create a layer of truth and validation.

Our proposed solution was to mirror how it already works in real life: checkpoints within transport, where each checkpoint would have to give their approval on the cargo. Now, those checkpoints would become nodes within a blockchain. The genesis blockchain would be tied with the very start of this transport cycle, and each facility this cargo had to pass through would in turn become a node for this blockchain. Given the very nature of the blockchain, this would create a security layer that would be extremely difficult to break into and tamper with.
